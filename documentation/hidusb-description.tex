\subsection{Design Under Verification}
Based on prior work\cite{usbkbd}, we intend on verifying a section of the Linux kernel
that contains kernel modules related to USB Human Input Devices (HID).
These modules are used to interact with HID devices in order to provide a bridge layer
to the input kernal module.
This area of kernel design is an important design to test as it is an active vector
for physical attacks on a computing system.
\par
We intend to test usbmouse.c first \cite{usbhid}, 
which is a complex program of just over 200 sloc that interacts with the kernelspace using
the Linux Kernel API.
Per the prior work, we see that there is a need to build a framework around this kernel module
in order for it to instantiate properly, so work will need to be done to properly construct
this framework.
