\subsection{Description of LLBMC Tool}
LLBMC is a static software analysis tool for finding bugs in programs written in C \cite{llbmc}.
The choice of LLBMC is therefore good as the Linux Kernel is written in C language.
Also, the choice for usnig this Bounded Model Checking tool is good in our case as it is 
mainly intended to check low-level system code.
LLBMC can achieve high test coverage ratios.
Also, LLBMC is powerful in a way because it supports all C construct including bitfields.
It is a great tool to find memory access errors like heap and stack buffer overflows.
LLBMC uses SMT solver as backend and therefore achieve higher performances.
Its analysis results are closer to what actually runs on the machine.
