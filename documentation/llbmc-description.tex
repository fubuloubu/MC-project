\subsection{LLBMC is a static software analysis tool for finding bugs in  C and C++ program.The choice of LLBMC is, therefore, good as the Linux Kernel is written in C language.Also, the choice for this Bounded Model Checking tool is good in our case as it is mainly intended to check low-level system code.
The comparison of this Bounded Model Checking tool with the Klee tool would bring out some interesting observation on the differences between Bounded Model Checking and also the Symbolic Execution approach.
LLBM can achieve high test coverage ratios.Also, LLBM is powerful in a way because it supports all C construct including bitfields.It is a great tool to find memory access errors like heap and stack buffer overflows.LLBMC uses SMT solver as backend and therefore achieve higher performances.Its analysis results are closer to what actually runs on the machine.

In case LLBMC tool does not provide to be useful we are also considering CBMC tool.It is also a model checker for C and C++ programs.CBMC is GCC based not LLVM, so it would only be switched in case LLBMC won't provide useful results.

Also as an alternative is a change of driver from USB to some other driver or any equally complex program.The USB driver as of now referred to the usbmouse.c or usbkbd.c (Reference http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/hid/usbhid/usbmouse.c)
Also as an approach to test the tools first, a bug known program would be used and then the main experiment on the USB driver.}
