% CSEE 6863 Formal Verification HW/SW Systems
% Length: 1-2 pages, Due: October 27th
% Instructions:
%   Describe your project. What are the project goals? Include any relevant background.
%
%   Describe how your project relates to formal verification. In particular, explain how it 
%   relates to the main topics discussed in the course.
%
%   If your proposal includes any steps that may fail, such as using a tool on your own 
%   design or program, please include a plan-B (fallback) option. For example, a fallback 
%   option for using a tool on your own design could be extending a design that comes with the tool.
%
%   Use figures!
%
%   Important: You must disclose all sources that you intend to use. If your project is based on 
%   any of your prior work, it must be disclosed as well.

    % Describe project goals
    The project seeks to test the driver mentioned above in a relevant context of proving
    that the software module meets the intended design parameters and is free of all bugs
    being tested, including concurrency and usage errors.
    \par
    %TODO
    % Describe plan B
    If we are unable to create a meaningful framework for testing the driver, we
    will resort to testing a piece of software that one of the team members has developed.
    The following is a description of the VisLang compiler that Bryant Eisenbach developed
    for COMS W4115 (Programming Languages and Translators) in Summer 2015 using the OCaml
    programming language (which has LLVM bindings for a compilation target).
    This project will be used as a Plan B.
