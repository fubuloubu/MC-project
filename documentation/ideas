Comparision of BMC tool LLBMC and Symbolic Execution tool klee for C programs using LLVM (maybe on a linux driver or GNU tool)
  GNU tool may be hard to find bugs
  Linux piece might be easier to play with
Comparision of several Model Checking tools on several standard benchmarks or Examples for Div By Zero, Race Conditions, Deadlocks
  Better to do above
Model checking of System C to RTL code generation (how good it is)
  Could work, if a reasonable framework were decided. Input space is really big for compiler.
