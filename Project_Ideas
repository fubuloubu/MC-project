Ideas for Project:
1.) Performing Model Checking on Linux Kernel Codebase
2.)Performing Model Checking Tools for Example Codes for Div By Zero, Race Conditions, Deadlocks
3.) RTL Design from CTOS generated by System C and Running The Model Checking for HW Verification for the Generated RTL( We can sort of publish about the reliablity from RTL's generated by CTOS)
4.) Performing Model Checking on Benchmark Programs
5.) Performing Model Checking on RTL of some basic processor design
6.) Professor Suggested Project
